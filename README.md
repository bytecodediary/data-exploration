## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.8 or higher)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) (Python package installer)

## Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bytecodediary/data-exploration.git
   ```
   
   ```
   cd data-exploration
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment**:

You can use venv to create a virtual environment. Run the following command:

```bash

python -m venv venv
```

This will create a directory named venv in your project folder.

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

```bash

venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux:

```bash

        source venv/bin/activate
```

After activation, your command prompt should change to indicate that the virtual environment is active.

## Installing Requirements

Once your virtual environment is activated, you can install the required packages listed in requirements.txt:

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command will install all the dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.
